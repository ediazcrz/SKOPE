enrolled in architecture classes will utilize the project for virtual, and site investigations of the SIPA building located on the FIU campus. 
Students will learn about various features of the building through interaction with simulations and animations to better understand how the building works.

Recommended Software:

Unity Version: 2018.2.7

To begin android development in Unity please make sure that android sdk and java 8 is installed. Easiest route would be to install android studio as opposed to just 
the sdk as Unity may have a difficult time locating the folder in your system. For ios make sure that xcode is installed.
Also when installing Unity make sure that ios, android and vuforia build support is selected during installation.
